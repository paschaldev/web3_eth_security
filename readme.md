# "En-Ef-Thieves" - Staying safe on the decentralized Web (Web3)

In 2020, an Animated Flying Cat With a Pop-Tart Body Sold for Almost $600,000. 

At that time, this news broke on the internet, and "normies" couldn't understand why an animated GIF would sell for that amount when you could right-click and save this same image. Why would anybody spend that amount on digital art called NFTs? What are NFTs?

"normies" - People who are not involved in the cryptocurrency world. They may be interested in Bitcoin or other digital assets but don't comprehensively understand the technology or the ecosystem.

#### For normies;

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. It is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain, which is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged for one another, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.

Smart contracts, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and decentralized web applications (dApps) are three core concepts in the world of blockchain technology. Together, they provide the foundation for decentralized, trustless systems that can automate complex processes and transactions.

A smart contract is a computer program or a protocol that lives on the Blockchain and executed when certain conditions are met. 

#### If you trade NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens);

When you purchase a NFT from a marketplace like Opensea, behind the scenes, you're interacting with a Smart contract. This smart contract acts as a broker; it takes your money (ETH token) and gives you a NFT so long as certain conditions are met. You trust the Smart contract because it's code is immutable, exists on the Blockchain, can never be modified; whatever is stored on the Blockchain is permanant and open to the public.

Over the past year, we've seen more projects and digital arts selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars on the Blockchain. One of the most popular, "Bored Ape Yacht Club" has captured the attention of many celebrities like Steph Curry and one of America's greatest rapper, Eminem.

This recurring news also piqued the interest of other individuals who wanted to take a bite from this "internet money"; By design, decentralization means there is no customer support. If your tokens leave your wallet to another wallet you do not own nor control, there is no way to recover that token. It's gone for Life.

Here is my step-by-step guide on how to stay safe while trading NFTs. With this approach, I've never been a vcitim of a wallet compromise.

- Buy 2 Ledgers from the official site only.
- One of the ledgers (Ledger A) should hold your ERC-20 tokens like $USDT, $ETH, $BTC, $SOL, $USDC. Do not use this Ledger for NFT transactions. This Ledger is your COLD wallet.
- The second Ledger (Ledger B) will be your semi-COLD wallet. You can use this Ledger to hold valuable NFTs, Like Ledger A, you must not use this Ledger for any transactions. Do not sign any contract with this wallet.
- 2 MetaMask wallets. This will be your HOT wallets; One of the wallet, we'll label (Sales Wallet), this wallet is what you will use to trade on marketplaces; you can use this wallet to sign transactions but only on trusted marketplaces only like Opensea, X2Y2. Do not sign any contract on a foreign website.
- The second hot wallet is the least secured; we'll label this wallet: Mint Wallet. You can use this wallet strictly for minting and foreign sites you do not trust. 
- Do not store any valuable NFTs in any of your hot wallets.
- When you Mint or buy a NFT with your MINT Wallet, if you intend to sell it, you should send it to your Sales Wallet and make the trade from there. However, if your intention is to keep this NFT, send it to Ledger B.
- After any successful trade, send your ERC-20 tokens to Ledger A.
- If you plan to sell a NFT in Ledger B, send this NFT to the Sales Wallet and perform the trade from there.

Security is still a big concern in Web3; many have lost millions of dollars in a twinkle of an eye by signing the wrong transactions with their wallet. You want to make sure you minimize losses as much as you can. Do not put all your eggs in one basket.

Stay safe; WAGMI
